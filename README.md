This sample projects demonstrate how to separate Android Application code 
and Instrumentation Tests for this application.

Branches show how to do it in two ways:
  1. Branch "as_separate_project" goes with Instrumentation Tests in independent Android project;
  2. Branch "as_separate_module" goes with Instrumentation Tests in separate module outside the application folder.

This sample is based on "Basic sample for Espresso" (https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testing/tree/master/ui/espresso/BasicSample).
